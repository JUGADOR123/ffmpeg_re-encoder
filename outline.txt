Working on it -main.py:
    done - General info
    done - check python version
    done - if python not 3.10, exit
    done - ask if hardware accelerated
    done -check OS
    half done - if OS == not windows, run the rename script
    - run the probe() script
    - if errors on probing, show them and ask if they want to proceed
    - run the encode() script
    - show errors that occured while encoding
    - show stats()

done -dataclass: 
    done - hardware accelerated state
    done - total number of files renamed
    done - total number of failed renamed files
    done - total number of  probed files 
    done - total number of failed probed
    done - total number of files to encode
    done - list of files to encode (name)
    done - total number of encoded files
    done - total number of failed encoded files
    done - starting time
    done - ending time
    done - average encoding time
    done - expected time remaining?
    done - initial file size
    done - ending file size
    done - saved space
    done - percentage saved

rename.py will do last 
    -recursively go through the initial folder
    - if illegal character is found, replace it
    - if renaming fails, += to failed renamed files
    - if renaming dosent fail,+= to the file renamed counter
probe.py
    -recursively go through the initial folder
    - print file name and all of the codecs
    - += total file size
    - if codecs dont match to output, add to list of files to encode
    - if codecs dont match to output, += total of files to encode
    - if codecs do match, skip file
    - if probing fails += failed probed files
    - += total probed files
encode.py
    -recursively go through initial folder
    - if file name is on to encode list:
        - print initial size 
        - file start time
        - encode the file
        - end time
        - print end size
        - += total encoded size
        - update average encoding time
        - uptade expected time remaining
    - if encoding fails += to failed encoded files
    - if encoding dosent fails += to encoded files
stats.py
    - general stats:
        - print total files
        - print total encoded files
        - print total time taken
        - print average time taken
        - print initial size
        - print re encoded size
        - print space saved
    - error stats:
        - print the individual failed probes
        - print total failed probes
        - print the individual failed encodes
        - print the total failed encodes
